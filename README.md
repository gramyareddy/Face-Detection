# Face-Detection

Face Detection has one of the widest applications in Computer Vision.

Here, I have explored various Face Detectors that are most frequently used.

Haar Cascades
=============
1. The oldest FD used is probably haar cascades. This however could detect only "Frontal Face" and doesnt detect faces at various angles.

DLib
====
Dlib is written in c++ . Python wrappers , however, are available. There are HoG based and CNN based detectors.
DLib with CNN is found to have a better performance in real time Face detection
 
MTCNN
=====
MTCNN uses stages of CNNs for accurate detection. This , also is really awesome when it comes to real time detection.
